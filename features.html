				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p class="lead">What makes Dogen an easy and enjoyable experience</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Frontends <br> Designed with industry-standards compatibility in mind</h2>
				<p class="lead">Much work has been done in the IT industry in terms of formats for modeling and Dogen intends to make the most out of it. Dogen's architecture was designed from the ground up to be extensible any of the various formats used in the wild such as XSD (including JAXB's extensions), XML (including proprietary representations of models), XMI, eCore, etc. Support for all of these is in the roadmap.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Compact and focused</h2>
				<p class="lead">One of the key concerns of Dogen is avoiding Zawinski's law. With multiple decades of experience in Software Engineering, we have seen many a good project collapse under its own weight due to scope creep. Due to this, Dogen has a very focused mission, with a clear vision and definition of done. All features must be aligned to these. We have also designed a number of safety-hatch mechanisms into the engineering process such as maximum build times to avoid uncontrolled growth.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Open development process</h2>
				<p class="lead">Dogen uses the agile methodology to ensure timely releases. All sprints have public sprint logs, as exemplified here. Users can submit requests for features, either via the the Product Backlog or via GitHub issues. And, of course, Pull Requests are always welcome.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Backends <br> Designed with multi-language support in mind.</h2>
				<p class="lead">Dogen has had a focus on delivering its vision for C++-11 first as this was the language we wanted to develop in; but, from inception, Dogen's architecture was designed to support multiple programming languages. All the infrastructure is in place and in the roadmap, with support for Java and C# expected to start soon.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Designed with extensibility in mind</h2>
				<p class="lead">One of the cornerstones of the design of Dogen is extensibility. This manifests itself in the following ways: <br> A) support for consuming existing libraries and frameworks. Dogen allows users to make use of existing libraries such as STL, Boost, etc as well as any user supplied libraries. <br> B) ability to add additional features to the code generator. Users can define their own code templates or even completely new backends. <br> C) integration with existing code generation tools. Rather than reinvent the wheel, Dogen intends to reuse existing tooling such as ODB [1], Google Protocol Buffers [2], etc.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
				<h2>Write less boilerplate code</h2>
				<p class="lead">One of the key objectives of Dogen is to automate all code that can be deduced from the modeling information supplied by the user such as serialisation, relational database persistence, hashing and so on. Users should focus on the 20-30% of the code that adds value, instead of copying and pasting patterns. Dogen is designed from the ground up to provide as much coverage of the boilerplate code as required, and where it falls short, to be extended by its users.</p>
